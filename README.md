|   # Divorce Prediction using Machine Learning and PCA |
|                                                      |
|   ## Introduction                                   |
|                                                      |
|   This project aims to predict the likelihood of     |
|   divorce using machine learning techniques,         |
|   specifically utilizing Principal Component         |
|   Analysis (PCA) to improve the efficiency of the    |
|   model. The dataset used for this prediction is     |
|   "divorce_data.csv," and there's an additional      |
|   reference file, "reference.tsv," which presumably   |
|   contains relevant information about the dataset    |
|   or the features.                                   |
|                                                      |
|   ## Libraries Used                                 |
|                                                      |
|   The following Python libraries are used in this    |
|   project:                                          |
|                                                      |
|   ```python                                        |
|   import numpy as np                               |
|   import pandas as pd                              |
|   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                   |
|   import seaborn as sns                             |
|   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split |
|   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler   |
|   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression |
|   from sklearn.decomposition import PCA              |
|   from sklearn.metrics import classification_report   |
|   ```                                              |
|                                                      |
|   ## Data                                           |
|                                                      |
|   The project uses the following datasets:          |
|                                                      |
|   1. `divorce_data.csv`: This dataset is likely the  |
|   main dataset containing features and labels for   |
|   divorce prediction.                                |
|                                                      |
|   2. `reference.tsv`: This file seems to be a        |
|   reference file, but without more details, it's     |
|   unclear how it's used in the project. Please       |
|   provide additional information on how this         |
|   reference file is used, or if it's not relevant,   |
|   you can omit it.                                  |
|                                                      |
|   ## Workflow                                       |
|                                                      |
|   1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The first   |
|   step in the workflow is to load and preprocess    |
|   the dataset. This likely involves reading the CSV  |
|   file, handling any missing values, and preparing   |
|   the data for model training.                       |
|                                                      |
|   2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Before     |
|   building the prediction model, it's essential to  |
|   understand the dataset. EDA involves statistical   |
|   analysis and data visualization using libraries    |
|   like Matplotlib and Seaborn. It helps identify     |
|   trends, relationships, and potential insights from |
|   the data.                                         |
|                                                      |
|   3. **Feature Scaling**: Standard scaling is a      |
|   common preprocessing step in machine learning. It  |
|   ensures that all features have a similar scale,    |
|   which is particularly important for some algorithms|
|   such as PCA and logistic regression.               |
|                                                      |
|   4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is  |
|   used for dimensionality reduction. It transforms   |
|   the original features into a new set of            |
|   uncorrelated features (principal components). This |
|   reduces the complexity of the data while retaining |
|   the most critical information.                     |
|                                                      |
|   5. **Model Building**: A logistic regression model |
|   is chosen for this project. Logistic regression is|
|   a common algorithm for binary classification tasks |
|   like divorce prediction. The model is trained on   |
|   the preprocessed and PCA-transformed data.         |
|                                                      |
|   6. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the    |
|   model is evaluated using appropriate metrics. The  |
|   `classification_report` function is used to        |
|   provide detailed metrics such as precision, recall,|
|   F1-score, and accuracy.                            |
|                                                      |
|   ## Usage                                          |
|                                                      |
|   To run this project, make sure you have the        |
|   required libraries installed. You can run the code |
|   in a Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook  |
|   or any other Python IDE. Ensure that the           |
|   "divorce_data.csv" file is in the same directory   |
|   as the code file.                                 |
|                                                      |
|   The exact code implementation is not provided here,|
|   but the steps outlined above represent the general|
|   workflow of the project. You'll need to write the  |
|   code that corresponds to each step.                |
|                                                      |
|   ## Conclusion                                     |
|                                                      |
|   This project demonstrates the application of       |
|   machine learning, specifically logistic regression |
|   and PCA, to predict the likelihood of divorce based|
|   on a given dataset. The project's success depends  |
|   on the quality of the dataset, the effectiveness   |
|   of feature engineering, and the performance of the |
|   chosen machine learning model.                     |
|                                                      |
